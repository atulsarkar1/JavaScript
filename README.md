​I. Existing Knowledge and Familiarity (Strengths)
​Prior Automation Experience: The candidate demonstrated knowledge of established automation tools, specifically Selenium.
​Version Control & CI/CD Tools: The candidate is familiar with foundational tools for team collaboration, including SourceTree (Git GUI client) and GitLab (CI/CD and repository management).
​II. Gaps and Areas for Development
​A. Playwright (Core Skill Gap)
​Framework Depth: The candidate lacks "vast knowledge" in Playwright, despite claiming 3 years of experience. The understanding appears to be limited to a high-level overview.
​Practical Application: He was unable to demonstrate writing core Playwright syntax during the interview.
​Framework Structure: The candidate did not have clear knowledge regarding the standard Playwright project structure (e.g., config files, test directory organization).
​Ecosystem Awareness: He was not aware of essential Playwright packages (e.g., specific reporters, utility libraries).
​B. Related Automation Skills
​BDD/Cucumber: Knowledge of BDD Cucumber principles and implementation was unclear or inadequate.
​Core Git Proficiency: The candidate demonstrated that they were unaware of basic GIT command-line operations, suggesting reliance solely on GUI tools like SourceTree.
